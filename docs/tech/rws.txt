---- Start window style data ----

The window style data is just 9 bitmaps.  There is one bitmap for each of the
corners of the window and one for each edge.  The edge bitmaps are just
repeated until a new corner should be drawn.  The last bitmap is the bitmap
that should be tiled in the center of the window.

The bitmaps are in this order in the file:
  Upper-left
  Top
  Upper-right
  Right
  Lower-right
  Bottom
  Lower-left
  Left
  Middle
