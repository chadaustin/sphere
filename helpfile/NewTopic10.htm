</font></P><FONT face=Verdana>
      <P><STRONG>New</STRONG></P>
      <P>Clicking the new&nbsp;menu item, in the file&nbsp;menu,&nbsp;will
      reveal a submenu which includes New Project, Map, Spriteset, Image,
      Script, Font, Window Style. </P>
      <P>When clicking on New Project, a prompt titled "New project" appears.
      Choose a project name which presumably is short and sweet as it will also
      be your projects folder name, then choose a Game Title, which will be the
      title for your game. Click the&nbsp;OK button&nbsp;and a new project will
      be created.</P>
      <P>When clicking on the Map submenu item,&nbsp;a dialog box asking where
      you want to save your map will appear, save it in your &lt;"project
      name"\map&gt; folder where project name without the inverted commas will
      be the name you named your project or your project title. Next, click on
      the project window, the text saying map and your map name will pop out
      below like using window explorer's tree view double click on that text
      with your map name and a message box will come out asking you whether you
      want a new map, click yes, then, specify the width of your map and next
      the height, now come sthe harder part to new users, the tileset box. Let
      me explain what a tileset is, in tile-based games, mostly rpg's like the
      one you're gonna create, you have something called a tileset which is a
      group of pictures placed side by side and the game engine will "cut" these
      tiles up and put each tile on the game board. Too difficult, well it's
      even more difficult for me to explain it then so maybe each of you can use
      a premade tileset instead of creating your own. So now to import&nbsp; the
      tile set, click the button with the "..." which is like a browse button
      and find your tileset. Now tilesets can be converted into rts format by
      clicking File&gt;Import&gt;Image to Tileset. So after loading the tileset
      click ok and you can now create your own map. Just click the tile you want
      in the tileset window and shade the squares you want that tile in, in the
      map window. You can edit your tileset by clicking the tileset tab in the
      map window.</P>
      <P>When Clicking on SpriteSet you will be allowed to draw and animate your
      own characters from scratch. First click on the first box in the frames
      tab(a tab is the thing sticking out from above the label saying North)with
      the North Label beside and click edit. Then draw your image and then go
      back to the frames tab, select the next box and draw the next image of
      your character and then the next like a sequence of pictures that allow
      you to animate objects. North, South and so on means the direction your
      character is facing. Good luck in doing your spriteset.</P>
      <P>Clicking on the Image option in the menu will allow you to edit a image
      to display as a title screen or end screen or anywhere else in your game.
      Just choose a color and draw your picture.</P>
      <P>Clicking on the Script option will allow you to write a script, for
      more information on how to write a script, check out the script tutorials
      included or check out the functions for the scripting language for Sphere
      included in this Help Package.</P>
      <P>Clicking on the Font option will allow you to create your own set of
      fonts where there is a row of blank boxes for you to draw your font which
      goes in a special order.</P>
      <P>Clicking on the window style option will allow you to draw your own
      window style boxes which will be used in your game.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Open</STRONG></P>

      <P><BR><STRONG>Import</STRONG></P>

      <P><BR><STRONG>Save All Windows</STRONG></P>
      <P>Saves all the active documents in the active windows. Very useful if
      you are editing a project with lots of files and all are open and you want
      to save all at a go.</P>
      <P><BR><STRONG>Options</STRONG></P>
