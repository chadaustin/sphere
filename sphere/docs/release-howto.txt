= How to make a release =

First grab NSIS (nullsoft scriptable install system) from

  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

Make sure the version numbers are correct in:

  source/common/sphere_version.h
  installer/sphere.nsi

Then run ./make-installer.sh in a terminal.

Or compile it as per docs/build/build-*.txt, and open
installer/sphere.nsi in NSIS, and make it from there.
