How to Build Sphere in Windows with Cygwin
--------

Chad Austin (aegis@aegisknight.org)
Spherical (http://www.spheredev.org/)
2006.08.27 (Version 1.12)



Requirements
--------

An Internet Connection
Cygwin (www.cygwin.com)
SCons (www.scons.org)



Getting the Source Code
--------

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.


Getting Third-party Headers, Libraries, and DLLs
--------

Sphere depends on a lot of external code.  You can download them all
individually, or get prebuilt libraries and headers for mingw on the
SourceForge downloads page
(https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1551).

After you have all of the headers and libraries, put them in
SPHERE_ROOT/third-party-mingw

There should be two directories inside of
SPHERE_ROOT/third-party-mingw...  include and lib.


Compiling
--------

Open a Cygwin prompt, cd to the sphere directory, and type:

scons compiler=mingw

If you have troubles, send me an e-mail (address at the top of the
document). NB: Since the writing of this document, Chad has passed
the Sphere project to Brian Robb (a.k.a. Flikky). Since he hasn't
been around too often either, your best bet for help is the Spherical
community (http://www.spheredev.org/). Ask at the forums.
