Sphere Source Code ChangeLog (Date format is dd/mm/yy)

18/08/06 :
[-] wxEditor and Editor project from Sphere workspace.
[-] Removing some (unused) directory.
[+] Restructure some directory and output target.
[+] Formating the source code with AStyle (through CodeBlocks).
[+] Update the third party libs (Corona, Audiere, SpiderMonkey<JS>) to the latest (that I have).
[+] Update the project file to VC++ 7.1 (VS 2003).
[*] Fix various error in the source due to the update and reformating.

19/08/06 :
[+] ported to VC Express 2005 (8.0)
[+] added dx8 libs and header to third party directory, update dx8 driver project.
[+] fix some directory issue
[+] added XP_WIN to preprcessor definition in engine to enable new JS

20/08/06 :
[*] fix some directory, header issue. After this changes hopefully this package will
    compile and build 'out of the box' (you still need PSDK and VC Express ;| ).

some known issue about this version :
1. security warning, this is generated by default by MSVC Express 2005 due to their new secure CRT
   lib. ignore if you get lot's of warning (or simply set the pragma warning where appropriate)
2. the engine build produces engine.lib and engine.exp, I dunno bout this, could some track down the compiler
   option that causes this ?? AFAIK it doesn't bother the binary, it still runs fine.
