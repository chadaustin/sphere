Building Sphere in Linux (g++)
--------

Spherical (http://www.spheredev.org/)
2008.01.08 (Version 1.4)


= NB: UBUNTU USERS =

A step-by-step, easy-to-follow guide is available at Spheriki:

 http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Compiling_Sphere


= Requirements =

As with all software, try to find these in your distro's repositories
before attempting to download, compile and install manually. The URLs
have been provided in case such a package is not available through
such means.

== Essential for building Sphere ==

* A C++ compiler (such as g++)
* scons (http://www.scons.org/)

== Essential libs ==

* Audiere (http://audiere.sf.net/)
* Corona (http://corona.sf.net/)
* libmng (http://www.libmng.com/)
* libpng (http://www.libpng.org/)
* SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
* SpiderMonkey JS (http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/)
* zlib (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

== Optional libs ==

* libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/)
* libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com/)
* wxwidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)


= Installing the dependencies =

Since Audiere and Corona are somewhat rare in the package
repositories, it is likely that they will be the ones that you will
need to compile and install manually (I found audiere inside apt
repositories, no such luck with corona).

Skip down a few sections if you need help with the other packages.

== Corona ==

Once you have corona.tar.gz, extract it like this:

 gunzip corona-1.0.2.tar.gz
 tar -xf corona-1.0.2.tar

Enter the directory and build it:

 cd corona-1.0.2/
 ./configure
 make

And install it as root:

 sudo make install

OR

 su
 <enter root password>
 make install

Sometimes the lib will be installed to a location the system can't
find it (such as /usr/local/lib/), so we should copy the symbolic
link to the library to where it can be found (/lib/ or /usr/lib):

 cd src/.libs/
 cp libcorona-1.0.2.so /lib

OR

 cp libcorona-1.0.2.so /usr/lib

Then run ldconfig as root to update your library path details. If
you're already root from before, just type the following. Otherwise,
run the following command with sudo, or run su and then run the
following command.

 ldconfig

You're done, but if you want to check that corona supports PNG:

 cd ../../examples/formats/
 ./formats

Does it say png is supported? Good! If not, Sphere pretty much won't
run.

== Audiere ==

The process is similar to that of installing Corona. Extract:

 gunzip audiere-1.9.4.tar.gz
 tar -xf audiere-1.9.4.tar

Change directory and build it:

 cd audiere-1.9.4/
 ./configure
 make

Install it as root:

 sudo make install

OR

 su
 <enter root password>
 make install

Sometimes the lib will be installed to a location the system can't
find it (such as /usr/local/lib/), so we should copy the symbolic
link to the library to where it can be found (/lib/ or /usr/lib):

 cd src/.libs/
 cp libaudiere-1.9.4.so /lib

OR

 cp libaudiere-1.9.4.so /usr/lib

Then run ldconfig as root to update your library path details. If
you're already root from before, just type the following. Otherwise,
run the following command with sudo, or run su and then run the
following command.

 ldconfig

== Everything else ==

The same process of

 ./configure && make && sudo make install

works as a general guide for most everything that comes as source in
Linux. Specific instructions can be found in build-linux-old.txt, in
the same directory as this document, targeting RPM-based distros, and
also Gentoo users.


= Getting the Sphere source =

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.

They should be either:

 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@sphere.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sphere co sphere

or

 export CVS_RSH=ssh
 cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@sphere.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sphere co sphere

A subdirectory named sphere should appear in the current directory,
depending on how you've configured your CVS client.


= Building Sphere =

Now for the fun bit! We can now build Sphere natively for Linux, so
type these:

 cd sphere/
 scons

You should get the first few lines looking like:

 [brian@localhost sphere]$ scons
 scons: Reading SConscript files ...
 Using compiler: linux
 Found sdl-config: /usr/bin/sdl-config
 Using subsystem:  unix

Note that if it doesn't say "Using compiler: linux" then
you'll have to use "scons compiler=linux" rather than just "scons".


= Running Sphere =

The engine and wxeditor should be located in sphere/build/linux/,
so we can try them out now.

 cd build/linux/
 ./engine

And for wxeditor (it's not that great, truth be told):

 ./wxeditor


= Getting help =

The Spherical community welcomes anybody with an interest in the
Sphere RPG engine, and will gladly help out anybody who is having
trouble building it from source. The community website is at the top
of this document, and the forums are always active
(http://www.spheredev.org/forums/), so drop by and say hi!
