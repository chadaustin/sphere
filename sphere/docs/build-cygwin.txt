Requirements
--

An Internet Connection
Cygwin (www.cygwin.com)
SCons (www.scons.org)



Getting the Source Code
--

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.


Getting Third-party Headers, Libraries, and DLLs
--

Sphere depends on a lot of external code.  You can download them all
individually, or get prebuilt libraries and headers for mingw on the
SourceForge downloads page
(https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1551).

After you have all of the headers and libraries, put them in
SPHERE_ROOT/third-party-mingw

There should be two directories inside of
SPHERE_ROOT/third-party-mingw...  include and lib.


Compiling
--

Open a Cygwin prompt, cd to the sphere directory, and type:

scons compiler=mingw

If you have troubles, send me an e-mail (address at the top of the
document).
