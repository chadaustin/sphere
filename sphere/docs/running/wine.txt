Running Sphere under Linux using Wine
-----------------------------------------------

Sphere has been confirmed to work acceptably under
Wine. Some users may still experience problems
with audio.

Don't forget that as of version 1.12, Sphere's
source can easily be compiled under Linux for
native sound, video and increased performance to
boot.

What you need:

1. A quite recent version of wine and kernel
   OR
   Winex 2 or above (Cedega)
   (could work with earlier though)
2. Latest sphere binaries
3. mfc42.dll*

* You can retrieve it this way:

Mount you windows drive. Open up your windows
directory, browse to system32 if you're using
XP or system if you're using earlier versions
of windows. Then, search and copy mfc42.dll to
your working directory.

Extract the latest sphere binaries to your working
directory.

Put mfc42.dll there as well.

If you want to run Sphere inside a virtual Windows
desktop, rather than a window inside your window
manager (KDE or GNOME), run winecfg and set
Desktop to "640x480"

Now open the terminal or run dialog and type:

 wine editor.exe

or

 winelauncher editor.exe

To run Sphere itself, you can press the lightning
bolt toolbar button, or substitute editor.exe for
engine.exe.
