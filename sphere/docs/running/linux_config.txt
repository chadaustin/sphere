= Configuring Sphere under Linux =

Currently, there is no graphical interface for configuring Sphere under
Linux. But fret not; the instructions are right here.

All configuration options are placed in the file "engine.ini", in the
same directory as the Sphere engine binary itself.


== Audio ==

This setting is ignored.


== Filter ==

This allows you to set the colour filter of Sphere's graphical output.
Don't use it yet, it's really ugly, even on full alpha.

* r - Red component of filter (0 - 255)
* g - Green component of filter (0 - 255)
* b - Blue component of filter (0 - 255)
* a - Alpha component of filter (0 - 255)


== Network ==

Enables or disables the ability for Sphere to access the local network
and the Internet.

* Allowed - 1 to enable, 0 to disable


== Player[1-4] ==

Sets the keys used by up to four different players. At the time of
writing, only the direction keys can be set.

* JoypadAllowed - 1 to enable joypad/stick, 0 to disable for the player
* KeyboardAllowed - 1 to enable keyboard input, 0 to disable
* KeyUp, KeyDown, KeyLeft, KeyRight - A keycode each, as described in
  docs/development/keys.txt, determining the player's keyboard controls


== Video ==

Recently, the Linux SDL video driver has been brought up to speed with
the Windows drivers, namely in terms of features.

* Driver - sdl32 for 32-bit graphics (default), sdl16 for 16-bit
* Filter - 0 to disable (default), 1 to enable
* Fullscreen - 0 to start in windowed mode, 1 to start in fullscreen
  mode. This can be toggled at any time while Sphere is running by
  pressing F10.
* Render - scale2x for 2x scaling, scale3x for 3x scaling. Leave it
  blank to default to no scaling, which is faster most of the time.
* ShowCursor - 0 to hide the mouse cursor when it is inside the Sphere
  window, 1 to let it show.
