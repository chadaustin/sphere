Some Information About Packages

Sphere supports building packaged versions of games, where all of the
game's data is contained in one SPK file.  To build a package, look in
the editor's Project menu while a game project is open.

Anyone who has installed Sphere can run packages by double-clicking on
them within Windows Explorer.  Sphere creates a "packages" directory
which contains a list of package names.  If Sphere tries to write a
file, it goes in that directory.  Also, "override" files can be put
there if you wish to later override them.

You can also run a package using the command line,
with a command like:

engine -package package.spk
