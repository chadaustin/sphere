Why Sphere Sucks

PROBLEM:

Okay, Kisai and the_Speed_Bump had the right idea all along.  (I'm sure kepler would agree with them too).  Having doodads and person entities as separate things doesn't make much sense.  Moreover, the spriteset file format is designed incorrectly.  Spritesets are currently stored and represented as a list of directions, each of which has a list of frames.  The ideal way of doing this would be storing the frames as a list of images, and storing the directions as lists of indexes into the frame array (this is how VERGE 2 currently works).


SOLUTION:

I want to change Sphere so that there is only one entity type (it would support the needs of both person entities and doodads).  I also want to completely redesign the spriteset file format and editor.


PROBLEM #2:

I need to make a Sphere release.  However, these changes are going to take some time, so I think what I'll do is put out a release of what I have and then work on this spriteset/doodad/spriteset issue.  When that's done, Sphere should be ready for another release.


COMMENTS:

(this is more evidence that Sphere and VERGE 3 are becoming the same program ;)

Time to make some ramen and do some thinking.  :)
