Make sure DrawText does range checking on the characters


-=[ MEDIUM PRIORITY ]=-

gradient & tile backgrounds for windowstyles
synchronize volume fades to video fades
more window style functions
drawing text to surfaces!
gradient rectangles and all that jazz within surfaces
> * An undo option for map mode.
preview tile animations
Event handlers for tiles
editing Sphere files (databases) in the editor
improve surface rotation
implement predefined tile sections (even within engine, so people can change things like roofs)
export to PNG for file formats
transformblit surfaces
BindMouseButton
determine height of wordwrapped strings


-=[ LOW PRIORITY ]=-

Sphere errors should throw exceptions
Errors should be logged to a file
DirectInput support
[11:47] <FireMoth> 2: Make the source-window refreshable to fix the font & color.
[16:54] <WorkInProgress> Could you put a window that has a zoomed out view of the map? That way you could navigate easier
Fix the file type registration in the editor options dialog box
hotkeys for everything?
Some JS debugger API
import group of images into tileset
import group of tilesets into current tileset
grabbing a map layer as an image from within the engine  o_O
animation editor in Sphere
image conversion when adding to project
Fix bug when you open script window it doesn't get focus
Context-sensitive help
FIX THE FUCKING MAP EDITOR
a console
Fix anti-aliasing of imported Windows fonts
separate map file I/O code into sections (for layers, entities, etc)
recall palettes
right-clicking on script and having "Set game script"
sending all of an object on a socket

non-rectangular spriteset obstructions
support "image" maps instead of "tile" maps?
think about optimizing alpha blending in standard16 and standard32 - http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/content/content.jsp?cntKey=Legacy::irtm_AP554_10022&cntType=IDS_EDITORIAL
opening log files in editor
sprite scaling in map engine
fading map music (smoothly like SetColorMask)
reordering layers at runtime
gravity simulator
malis: blitting tiles

Bug fixes
Linux/BeOS port
Update *all* documentation
Find and fix memory leaks
Make system constants special objects so people don't guess values anymore

MUST DO THIS

[18:39] <Hatchet> you should also, at some point, have a map option for "looping". Ie walk past one side and appear on the other, like any world map

[03:48] <malis> ak: BTW, GetPersonHeight, GetPersonWidth, GetPersonBaseWidth, GetPersonBaseHeight, GetPersonBaseXOnSprite, Get PersonBaseYOnSprite? =P

[21:05] <FireMoth> AK: Like, an editior where you edit the tile groupings. Say you have a 2x3 tile grouping, you go to edit, you see the 2x3 area with the tiles in it. Going from one tile to another is seamless.
[21:06] <FireMoth> ak: You drop the tiles into a single coherent image, edit, and then split back.

[21:06] <mal[cos]> in the tile editor, a preview of a 4x4 (or 9x9) mapping of the tile to test tilability

[17:17] <aegisk> Reflective tiles that work as long as an entity is *above* them, not if the entity is on that current layer.
That's basically what i want, (it'd make things a lot easier) thanks a bunch

malis:  reflection distance


[21:41] <malis|ccr> aegis, there needs to be surface variables called width or height or something so i can reference them when doing a rescale
[21:41] <aegis> There aren't?  o_O
[21:41] <malis|ccr> not listed.
[21:41] <aegis> No getWidth or getHeight either?

[21:22] <WorkInProgress> How about having shortcut keys in the Font Editor so when you press a letter, it goes to that letter in the font?
