Sphere Linux HOWTO

To compile the sphere engine under linux you need several other libraries.
(okay, a lot of other libraries)

Where I show filenames below, they are the ones I installed.
If newer versions are available, you should probably install those instead.

You need:

a C++ compiler, such as g++
corona  -  http://corona.sf.net/
audiere  -  http://audiere.sf.net/
spidermonkey  -  http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/
  or the spidermonkey.tar.gz found at the files page at http://sf.net/projects/sphere/
SDL  -  http://www.libsdl.org/
libmng  -  http://www.libmng.org/
libpng  -  http://www.libpng.org/
scons  -  http://www.scons.org/

zlib (compression library, http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

Optionally, you can also get:

libvorbis  -  http://www.vorbis.com
libjpeg  -  http://www.ijg.org/ or ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/ 

[The editor does not yet build in linux.]
To also install wxeditor, you will need:

wxwindows  - http://www.wxwindows.org/


-----------------------------------------------------------

To install SDL:
You need the SDL development library RPM, and so you do something like:

rpm -i libSDL1.2-devel-1.2.5-5mdk

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install corona:
You download the corona.tar.gz file, and so you do something like:

gunzip corona-1.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xf corona-1.0.0.tar
cd corona-1.0.0
./configure
make
make install

The next step may just be me... but you need to make sure the lib is properly installed, so:

cd src
cd .libs
cp libcorona-1.0.0.so /lib # or cp libcorona-1.0.0.so /usr/lib

This is just a check you can do, feel free to skip it, but I like to make sure corona supports png, so you do:
cd ..
cd .. # we should be back in corona-1.0.0 now
cd examples/formats
./formats

If it says png is supported? Good news, if not, sphere pretty much wont run.

Then run ldconfig to update your library path details.

su
ldconfig

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install audiere:
You download the audiere.tar.gz file, and you do something like:

gunzip audiere-1.9.2.gz
tar -xf audiere-1.9.2.tar
cd audiere-1.9.2
./configure
make
make install


The next step may just be me... but you need to make sure the lib is properly installed, so:

cd src
cd .libs
cp libaudiere-1.9.2.so /lib # or cp libaudiere-1.9.2.so /usr/lib

Then run ldconfig to update your library path details.

su
ldconfig

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install SpiderMonkey:
You download the SpiderMonkey.tar.gz file, and you do something like:

gunzip SpiderMonkey-1.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xf SpiderMonkey-1.5.0.tar
cd SpiderMonkey-1.5.0
./configure
make
make install

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install libmng:
You download the libmng.rpm file, and so you do something like:

rpm -i libmng1-devel-1.0.3-2mdk

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install SCons:
You'll need the scons RPM, and then you can do something like:

rpm -i scons-0.13-1.noarch.rpm

If you prefer using the tar.gz version, installing it looks like:

gunzip scons-0.13-1.tar.gz
tar -xf scons-0.13-1.tar
cd scons-0.13-1
python setup.py install

-----------------------------------------------------------

If all goes well, you now should be able to move onto installing sphere.

Getting the source

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.

Once you've done that, goto into the top level sphere directory and run scons

cd sphere
scons

You should get the first few lines looking like:

[brian@localhost sphere]$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Using compiler: linux
Found sdl-config: /usr/bin/sdl-config
Using subsystem:  unix


Hopefully, if all goes well, you'll be able to open the engine.

cd sphere
cd build
cd linux
./engine


If you feel I missed something out, please let me know.

-- Flik.
