Sphere Linux HOWTO

To compile the sphere engine under linux you need several other libraries.
(okay, a lot of other libraries)

Where I show filenames below, they are the ones I installed.
If newer versions are available, you should probably install those instead.

You need:

a C++ compiler, such as g++
corona  -  http://corona.sf.net/
audiere  -  http://audiere.sf.net/
spidermonkey  -  http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/
  or the spidermonkey.tar.gz found at the files page at http://sf.net/projects/sphere/
SDL  -  http://www.libsdl.org/
libmng  -  http://www.libmng.org/
scons  -  http://www.scons.org/

zlib (compression library, http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

Optionally, you can also get:

libvorbis  -  http://www.vorbis.com
libjpeg  -  http://www.ijg.org/ or ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/ 

To also install wxeditor, you will need:

wxwindows  - http://www.wxwindows.org/


To install SDL:
You need the SDL development library RPM, and so you do something like:

rpm -i libSDL1.2-devel-1.2.5-5mdk


To install corona:
You download the corona.tar.gz file, and so you do something like:

gunzip corona-1.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xf corona-1.0.0.tar
cd corona-1.0.0
./configure
make
make install

The next step may just be me... but you need to make sure the lib is properly installed, so:

cd src
cd .libs
cp libcorona-1.0.0.so /lib


To install audiere:
You download the audiere.tar.gz file, and you do something like:

gunzip audiere-1.9.2.gz
tar -xf audiere-1.9.2.tar
cd audiere-1.9.2
./configure
make
make install


The next step may just be me... but you need to make sure the lib is properly installed, so:

cd src
cd .libs
cp libaudiere-1.9.2.so /lib


To install SpiderMonkey:
You download the SpiderMonkey.tar.gz file, and you do something like:

gunzip SpiderMonkey-1.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xf SpiderMonkey-1.5.0.tar
cd SpiderMonkey-1.5.0
./configure
make
make install


To install libmng:
You download the libmng.rpm file, and so you do something like:

rpm -i libmng1-devel-1.0.3-2mdk


To install Scons:
You need the scons RPM, and then you do something like:

rpm -i scons-0.13-1.noarch.rpm


If all goes well, you now should be able to move onto installing sphere.

Getting the source

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.

Once you've done that, goto the directory and run SCons

cd sphere
scons

You should get the first few lines looking like:

[brian@localhost sphere]$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Using compiler: linux
Found sdl-config: /usr/bin/sdl-config
Using subsystem:  unix


Hopefully, if all goes well, you'll be able to open the engine.

cd sphere
cd build
cd linux
./engine


If you feel I missed something out, please let me know.
