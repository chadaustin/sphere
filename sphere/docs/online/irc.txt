Chatting with other Sphere users on IRC
--------

IRC is a technology that... it's a chatroom, okay? Speak with other
Sphere users.

1. Get XChat at http://www.xchat.org/
   OR
   Get Gaim at http://gaim.sourceforge.net/
2. Connect to server irc.esper.net, port 6667.
3. Join channel #sphere.
4. Say hello. :)

The occupants like to idle (read: stay silent), but don't let that
fool you, they'll spring up to answer even the smallest questions.
