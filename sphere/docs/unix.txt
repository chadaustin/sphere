Sphere for UNIX

Requirements:
- GNU C library
- SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library, http://www.libsdl.org/)
- libpng (Portable Network Graphics library, http://www.libpng.org/)
- libjpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group image library, http://www.ijg.org/)
- libmng (Multiple-image Network Graphics, http://www.libmng.org/)
- zlib (compression library, http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)
- SpiderMonkey (JavaScript-C Engine, http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/)
- a little-endian machine*

Currently the Sphere engine is the only component being ported.  Sound will not
be available until Audiere has been ported to UNIX also.

Instructions on building Sphere from source:

  1. Enter the top-level directory
**2. run ./configure --with-gamesdir directoryforspheregames
  3. run gmake (usually just make on most systems)
  optional: put a game in the games directory you specified during configure and run
            ./source/engine/sphere
  4. run gmake install to install sphere
  5. drop more games in the games directory and enjoy!

* The creator of Sphere (Chad Austin) assumes that Sphere will not run correctly
on big-endian machines.  From looking at the code I would have to agree.  If you
manage to run sphere on a big-endian machine, please tell us!

** If you choose not to specify a games directory be sure to set the environment
variable SPHEREDIR before running sphere.  You may specify --enable-debug if you
want debugging symbols (and consequently a massive binary).
