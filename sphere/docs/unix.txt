Sphere for UNIX

Requirements:
- GNU C library
- SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library, http://www.libsdl.org/)
- libpng (Portable Network Graphics library, http://www.libpng.org/)
- libjpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group image library, http://www.ijg.org/)
- libmng (Multiple-image Network Graphics, http://www.libmng.org/)
- lcms (Little CMS color engine, http://www.littlecms.com/)
- zlib (compression library, http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)
- SpiderMonkey (JavaScript-C Engine, http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/)
- a little-endian machine*

Currently the Sphere engine is the only component being ported.  More details, 
along with build instructions, can be found in the source/engine/unix directory.
The editor and support utilities may also get ported in the future (although
this would require significant source rewrites).

* The creator of Sphere (Chad Austin) assumes that Sphere will not run correctly
on big-endian machines.  From looking at the code I would have to agree.  If you
manage to run sphere on a big-endian machine, please tell us!
