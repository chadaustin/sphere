Sphere for UNIX

Requirements:
- GNU C library
- SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library, http://www.libsdl.org/)
- corona (http://corona.sf.net/)
- audiere (http://audiere.sf.net/)
- libmng (Multiple-image Network Graphics, http://www.libmng.org/)
- zlib (compression library, http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)
- SpiderMonkey (JavaScript-C Engine, http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/)
  you can get an autoconf distribution of SpiderMonkey from the files
  section of http://sf.net/projects/sphere
- a little-endian machine*

Currently the Sphere engine is the only component being ported.  Sound
will not be available until Audiere has been ported to UNIX also.

Instructions on building Sphere from source:

  1. Enter the top-level directory
**2. ./configure --with-data=spheredatadirectory (i.e. /usr/local/games/sphere)
  3. gmake (usually just make on most systems)
  4. gmake install to install sphere
  5. gmake install-data to install necessary data files (only if you specified
     a data directory)
  6. drop more games in the games directory and enjoy!

* The creator of Sphere (Chad Austin) assumes that Sphere will not run
correctly on big-endian machines.  From looking at the code I would
have to agree.  If you manage to run sphere on a big-endian machine,
please tell us!

** If you choose not to specify a data directory it will default to
the current directory.  You can override the default data directory by
setting the environment variable SPHERE_DATA_DIR or by using the
option -d directory from the commandline.  You may specify
--enable-debug if you want debugging symbols (and consequently a
massive binary).
