Requirements
--

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
Cygwin
SCons



Getting the Source Code
--

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.


Getting Third-party Headers, Libraries, and DLLs
--

Sphere depends on a lot of external code.  You can download them all
individually, or get prebuilt libraries and headers for VC6 on the
SourceForge downloads page
(https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1551).

After you have all of the headers and libraries, put them in
SPHERE_ROOT/third-party-msvc.  The third-party-msvc directory should
have two subdirectories inside of it: include and lib.


Compiling
--

Open sphere.dsw, and compile away.  If you'd rather build from the
command line (which has scripts to generate the installer), run the
'scons' command inside of the sphere directory.  If you have troubles,
send me an e-mail (address at the top of the document).
