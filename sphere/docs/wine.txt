Running Sphere under linux using Wine
-----------------------------------------------

What do you need:
 1) A quite recent version of wine and kernel
    -OR-
    Winex 2 or above
    (could work with earlier though)
 2) Latest sphere binaries
 3) mfc42.dll*

* You can retrieve it this way:
Mount you windows drive. Open up your windows
directory, browse to system32 if you're using
XP or system if you're using earlier versions
of windows. Then, search and copy mfc42.dll to
your working directory.

Extract the latest sphere binaries to your working
directory.

Put mfc42.dll there aswell.

Open you home directory. Enter the .wine dir-
ectory.

Open config in an editor

If you want, you should configure a desktop so
wine doesn't interfere with your current apps
running on your x server.

set

"Desktop" = "640x480"

Now open a command line.

Type wine editor.exe or winex editor.exe

You can not make or edit games and even play
them under whine without much problems.

If you own winex, there will also be sound.
Wine has problems with sound, configurations
differ per system.
