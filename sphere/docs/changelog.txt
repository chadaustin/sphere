YYYY.MM.DD

2009.04.04
  - Added mask blendmodes for image blitting.

2009.03.12
  - Parent and child particle systems now first call the standard renderer
    and then the 'on_render' callback function, if one has been previously set.
    
2009.03.08
  - Changes to the particle system:
      - Remapped descendants- and swarm-specific methods
        to their appropriate names 'descendants' and 'swarm'.
      - Added unique(), sort(), apply(), extract(), extractGroup(),
        getGroup(), contains(), containsGroup() to 'descendants'
        and renamed find() to get().
      - Added the 'type' property, the constants PS_PARENT
        and PS_CHILD and renamed the other particle system
        constants appropriately.
      - Particle systems are now initialized with full life, instead of
        zero life, for convenience.
      - Renderers now have the 'disabled' property, which is false by default
        and can be set to true in order to disable the standard renderer,
        e.g. to handle the rendering manually in an on_render callback.
        Their setters also root now a previously set image object, so it
        can be returned by the getter instead of always creating new image objects.
        This also enables to access renderer.texture just like an ordinary image
        object, as e.g. with 'renderer.texture.blit(x, y)'.
      - Rewrote particle initializer's JSAPI implementation. It features now the
        explicit setter and getter methods: getAgingParams(), setAgingParams(),
        getPosParams(), setPosParams(), getVelParams() and setVelParams().        

2009.02.26
  - Added sfxr
  - Added person base functions
  - Added WindowStyle border functions
  - Added Map background music functions
  - Added CreateSoundEffect(byte_array)

    blend modes ADD, SUBTRACT and MULTIPLY

2008.07.07
  - Fixed a bug in the ExecuteTriggerScript() function, which caused
    crashes with newer compilers than VC6.

2008.07.05
  - Fixed the bug, which didn't allow any calls to Sphere functions
    from within a default map exit script if Exit() was called.
  - Fixed a bug in the resolution expansion configuration of the 
    software based video drivers.
  - Tile animations, which do not loop, will now stop at the last
    tile in the animation row, instead of the first tile in the tileset.
  - Font and windowstyle dialogs in the editor now have correct
    startup colors selected in the palette.

2008.07.03
  - Fixed the *_gl video drivers to transform images correctly
    up to the given coordinates.
  - It is now possible to change the base, as well as index
    and delay of frames in spritesets from within scripts.

2008.07.01
  - Changed text controls in the editor to use Courier as the font
    and changed the font size from 8 to 10.

2008.06.29

    sockets with disconnected peers mark themselves as not connected.

2008.06.26
  - Added Rhuan's network code to the Mac and Linux subsystems.
  - sound.getPosition() will no longer lock up the engine if
    the sound is not seekable.

    new configurable keys: Menu, A, B, X and Y.
  - Player input configuration is now available for script
    via GetPlayerKey(player, key)
  - Fixed a bug in the color interpolation of gradient lines,
    which caused flipped gradients on vertical and horizontal lines.

    allow anymore for flipped images.
    
2008.06.23
  - Added missing documentation for CreateSpriteset().

2008.06.22
  - Engine no longer crashes when a layer renderer is
    set within a "on leave map" script.

2008.06.18
  - Fixed sound.pause() to pause MIDIs instead of stopping them.
  - Made the 'repeat' parameter in sound.play(repeat) to be optional.
    This allows for resuming the playback of a paused sound from it's 
    current position if sound.play() is called without any parameters.
    If 'repeat' is defined, the sound is set to the beginning and then played.
  - Added: sound.reset(), sound.getRepeat() and sound.setRepeat(repeat)
  - Added the new object SoundEffect with the following methods:
    sound_effect.play(), sound_effect.stop(), sound_effect.getVolume(),
    sound_effect.setVolume(), sound_effect.getPan(), sound_effect.setPan(),
    sound_effect.getPitch() and sound_effect.setPitch()

    after copying & pasting them.
  - Added backface culling and line and polygon smoothing
    (if "biliner filtering" is on) to the OpenGL drivers and
    removed the sphere_bla_to_opengl_bla() functions
    replacing them effectively with a one-time call to 
    glTranslate*() at the beginning.
  - Added missing documentation for file_object.close() to api.txt

2008.04.27

    and added sdl32 and sdl_gl as stand-alone video drivers.

2008.04.03

    where the clipping rectangle was not initialized properly
    after executing a game with a different resolution.

    which caused the engine to crash if e.g. spritesets were 
    changed frequently.

    and map properties dialogs, including bugfixes, rearranging
    controls, changing the dialogs to be resizeable, etc.

2008.03.14
  - Fixed editor bug, where a tile image kept being unchanged 
    after drawing on it, if "show tile obstructions" was active.
  - The person edit dialog in the editor will now keep the
    subdirectory in the filename for the spriteset.
  - Entity copy&pasting code uses now a built-in entity clipboard,
    instead of the Windows clipboard (no crashes related to this anymore).
  - Pasting a person from the clipboard will now generate a unique
    name for it, based on the spriteset and on the existing persons names.

2008.03.01
  - Added the possibility to export/replace spriteset images 
    palette to/from image in the spriteset editor.
  - Exporting the spriteset itself will now use the REPLACE 
    blend mode, which ensures a 1:1 copy.
  - Clicking on a already selected frame image in the spriteset
    images palette won't make the spriteset dirty anymore.

2008.02.28

    in the status bar.

2008.01.03
  - Applied Kyuu's input patch; removing GetJoystickX(), GetJoystickY();
    adding GetToggleState(), GetJoystickAxis(), GetNumJoystickAxes(),
