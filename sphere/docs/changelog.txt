  - make trigger location detection more reliable by checking one
    extra pixel to the left and one up so people can't slip between
    two adjacent triggers.
  - fix bug where switching from larger map to smaller map makes
    Sphere think smaller map is bigger than it really is
  - when inserting person entities into a map, put them one more pixel
    up and one more pixel left so they are aligned with tiles.
  - Started changelog.  SourceForge got rid of the mailing
    list archives (rather, they "haven't archived sphere-commits yet".
    They suck.
  - animate obstructions with tiles
