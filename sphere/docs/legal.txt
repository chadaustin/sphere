Sphere Legal Information

[Modifications to legal.txt made on 2001.04.23 by James Potts (Arek)]

Sphere is licensed under the GNU General Public License, either version 2 or,
at your option, any later version.  You should have received a copy of the GPL
with this distribution (in docs/gpl.txt).  If not, you can always find the
latest version at http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

Basically what this means is that Sphere must always be free.  The source must
always be free.  And I own the copyright, mwa ha.

People ask me about making games in Sphere and what you can and can't do with
them.  I personally would prefer that they be free with all the scripts available
for viewing.  However, you can go ahead and make commercial games or shareware or
whatever.  You can include the Sphere binaries with your game, although you must
say that Sphere is available for free at http://www.aegisknight.org/. 
Also please talk with me beforehand so I can approve the distribution.
I think that's all.

This document is a result of typing important stuff late at night.
