Requirements
--

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0



Getting the Source Code
--

Using your favorite CVS client, download the sphere module from CVS.
Instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1551>.


Getting Third-party Headers, Libraries, and DLLs
--

Sphere depends on a lot of external code.  You can download them all
individually, or get prebuilt libraries and headers for VC6 on the
SourceForge downloads page
(https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1551).

After you have all of the headers and libraries, put them in
SPHERE_ROOT/source/third-party.


Compiling
--

Open sphere.dsw, and compile away.  If you have troubles, send me an
e-mail (address at the top of the document).
