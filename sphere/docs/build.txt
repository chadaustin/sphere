How to build Sphere

(this may not be 100% accurate...  it's an initial draft)


Requirements:  Visual C++ 6.0

Go to the Sphere project page at http://sf.net/projects/sphere and either
download a nightly CVS snapshot or do a CVS pull yourself (there are
instructions on the page).

Download the Win32 third-party headers and libraries from the files section and
extract them somewhere on your hard drive, adding that directory to your Include
and Libraries directory (look in Tools | Options).

Open sphere.dsw and start hacking away.  :)
