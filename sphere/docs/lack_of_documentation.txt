Yes, I know...  There still isn't much documentation for Sphere.

However, come to #sphere (see irc.txt) and someone will be glad to help with
any problems you may have.  Also, check out Flik's site at

http://sphere.sf.net/flik/

Also, check out sphere.sf.net:

If you really can't figure it out, e-mail me at aegis@aegisknight.org and I'll
try to help out.
