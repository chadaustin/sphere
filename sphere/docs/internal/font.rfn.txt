--- 256 byte header ----

byte signature[4];   // Must be ".rfn"
word version;        // Must be 1 or 2
word num_chars;
byte reserved[248];


---- Start character data ----

Each character has its own 32-byte header that goes like this:

word width;
word height;
byte reserved[28];

If version is 1, character data is a series (width * height) of bytes representing an
8-bit greyscale image.  Color 255 is opaque, color 0 is transparent.  Version 1 doesn't
inherently have a color associated with it, but it should default to white.  If version
is 2, character data is a series of RGBA pixels.
