** fademessage.js **

I made this script so you can easily make nice dialogs and stuff, it's still in beta, expect
more later. This version is functional, it allows:
- Gradient bg
- Scroll effects
- Line skip
- Multiple lines
- 1 Character fade (each character has it's own Alpha)
- Textcolour changeable
- Center screen draw
- Auto size the textbox

USING

- EvaluateSystemScript("fademessage.js");
	Add the script to your game

- setWindowBehevior("RM2000.rfn", "menu.rws");
	Change the font and the window style you want to use

- setColours(c1, c2, c3, c4, tcol);
	Change the colour of bg and text
	c1 - c4 : the cornors of the bg
	tcol : colour of the text(do not use alpha, you wont see a dif)

- drawCenter(strings, speed, props);
	Draw a dialog in the center of the screen
	strings : the string array, if you use a normal string, you will
		  get chinese dialog ^^
	speed 	: speed in fps (5 = really slow, 10 = slow, 15 = med, 20 = normall, 100 = skip! duh)
	props	: propeties
			"ScrollUp" : Wrap the dialog to the above when done
			"ScrollDown" : Duh
			ps: more to come here!!!

- drawMessage(x,y,strings,speed,prop);
	Idem to drawCenter
