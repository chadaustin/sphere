clock.js by WIP (Trapper Bigelow)

There are no functions built-in to sphere
that can do a game clock, so I decided to
make my own function.

How to Use clock.js
Well, I use it in my game object. My game
object is just a variable that holds info
such as current party, money, etc. Well,
to use this clock, simply create a new
variable in your game object. If you don't
use game objects, simply make a new global
variable to put your clock in. For the new
variable, simply put:

var GameClock = new Clock();

Boom! You have a clock object. But the time
isn't ticking. So, you must start the clock:

GameClock.start();

Do this when your game ACTUALLY starts. The
clock object will start to keep track of the
time. To get the time from the clock, just
ask for the time! But make sure you put the
returned info into a variable:

var current_time = GameClock.getTime();

The variable current_time now has the time. So
to get the time from the variable, just access
the variables in it:

current_time.seconds = Seconds passed since clock was started
current_time.minutes = Minutes passed since clock was started
current_time.hours = Minutes passed since clock was started

So there you go. But what if you are loading a
game? Just put info into the clock object. 

GameClock.seconds = 45;
GameClock.minutes = 14;
GameClock.hours = 3;


Pieces of the Clock Object

clock.getTime()
- Returns an object that holds time

clock.seconds
- seconds of previous game loaded into clock

clock.minutes
- minutes of previous game loaded into clock

clock.hours
- hours of previous game loaded into clock
