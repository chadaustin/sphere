Ever wanted a house where the roof just disappears as you walk in?
Here's how it can be done.

First add the line:-

EvaluateSystemScript("layers.js");

This is so you can use the following functions:

ConvertLayer(layer_index, tile_index, dont_remember_details)
IsLayerConverted(layer_index)
ToggleLayer(layer_index, tile_index)
RevertLayer(layer_index)
ClearLayerTileDetails(layer_index)

Here's what you do on the map now:

You add a layer to the map and call it "roof layer"
You draw roof tiles on this layer.

Now also add a blank see through tile somewhere in your tileset.
I normally have this tile as the second tile in the tileset.

Where you have your door, add the trigger:

ToggleLayer(2, 1);

(Providing that the roof is on the third layer and the blank tile is the second tile in the tileset, the roof will disappear.)
