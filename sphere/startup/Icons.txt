In addition to all the normal stuff, you can have 25x25 any-image-file-sphere-supports icons for your game! How to do it:

Make an empty text file, rename it to <YouGame'sDirectory>.dat
In it have the following:

Icon=<ImageYouWantForAnIcon>

Then, for your game distrbutation have it extract the image you want into the startup game's image directory, and the .dat file into its save directory. And thats it.
